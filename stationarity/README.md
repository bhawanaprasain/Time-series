## Stationarity
A stationary time series has  its statistical properties like  mean, variance  and auto-correlation that do not vary with time.
So in stationary series:
* There is no trend
* There is no seasonality

However stationarity  does not mean that the time  series does not change over time. It changes in a Â way such that the way of change  does not itself change over time.

 Stationary processes are easier to analyze so we first try to figure the possibility to convert non-stationary data to stationary data.
