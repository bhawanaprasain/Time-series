## Stationarity
A stationary time series has  its statistical properties like  mean, variance  and auto-correlation that do not vary with time.
So in stationary series:
* There is no trend
* There is no seasonality

However stationarity  does not mean that the time  series does not change over time. It changes in a Â way such that the way of change  does not itself change over time.

 Stationary processes are easier to analyze so we first try to figure the possibility to convert non-stationary data to stationary data.
 
 ## Test for stationarity
 A basic approach for testing stationarity is to plot data and carry out visual checking for finding trends and seasonal components.
 However, we have statistical tests for stationarity. Two most common statistical tests are:
 
1.  Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
2.  Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) Test
